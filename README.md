# AR Game
This is a 2 player AR Game where One player is the attacker and the other, is the defender. In this case the player is the attacker, and the CPU is the defender. The attacker’s job is to reach the destination. The defender’s job is to catch the attacker before he reaches the destination.

The player will click on Play to start the game.

We have used surface detection from, A.R. Core and, A.R. Foundation to place the objects in the 3D space.

As the surface is being detected, a ring will appear on the screen denoting that a flat surface has been found successfully. Once you  tap on the screen, the map will spawn on the surface.

You are controlling the blue pawn. The CPU is controlling the red pawn. Your job is to reach the destination marked in blue. The CPU will try to stop you.

The player will go first. The player will tap on the dice icon and will get a randomly generated number. For example - If the player gets 3 on the dice, then the player has 3 time units to move their pawn. The player can do so by using the joystick to move in the desired direction within the allotted time.

After that a random number will be generated for the CPU. And the CPU will move the pawn in allotted time.

Here, the player’s pawn reaches the destination. So the player wins.

Here, the CPU’s pawn catches the player’s pawn. So, the CPU wins
